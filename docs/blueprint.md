## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark teal (#008080) to convey security, reliability, and trust.
- Background color: Very light greenish-blue (#E0F8F7), near-white, for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB347) to draw attention to calls to action and important information. This should not be overused, as it contrasts heavily with the teal and can create visual clutter if used too frequently.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font with a modern, neutral look, is recommended for both headlines and body text.
- Use a set of consistent icons for navigation and key actions; outline style icons are preferable for a modern look.
- Maintain a clean, organized layout with clear visual hierarchy; use white space effectively to avoid clutter and improve readability.
- Subtle animations to provide feedback and enhance the user experience; avoid excessive animations that distract from the app's core functionality.
